Description: Functions for sample size estimation and simulation in clinical
  trials. Includes methods for selecting the best group using the
  Indifference-zone approach, as well as designs for non-inferiority,
  equivalence, and negative binomial models. For the sample size calculation
  for non-inferiority of vaccines, the approach is based on Fleming, Powers,
  and Huang (2021) <doi:10.1177/1740774520988244>. The Indifference-zone
  approach is based on Sobel and Huyett (1957) <doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb02411.x> and
  Bechhofer, Santner, and Goldsman (1995, ISBN:978-0-471-57427-9).
