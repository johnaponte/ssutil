\description{
Estimates the probability of the best promising groups with the
lowest power to detect a difference between groups.
A simulation is made for a grid of probabilities and a quadratic
function is fitted to the estimated powers by probability. The
function returns the minimum probability from the quadratic function.
function.
It is restricted to 1 outcome.
