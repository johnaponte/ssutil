\title{Power to Correctly Select the Best Group in a Binomial Test}
\usage{
power_best_binomial(p1, dif, ngroups, npergroup)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{Numeric. Probability of success in the best group (must be in [0, 1]).}

\item{dif}{Numeric. Difference in success probability between the best group and the next best (must be > 0).}

\item{ngroups}{Integer. Number of groups (must be greater than 1).}

\item{npergroup}{Integer. Number of subjects per group (must be positive).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the probability of correctly identifying the best group.
}
\description{
Computes the exact probability of correctly identifying the best group
when the outcome follows a binomial distribution. It assumes that \code{p1}
is the probability of success in the best group, and that the success
probability in all other groups is lower by a fixed difference \code{dif}.
}
\details{
The formula is based on the exact method described by Sobel and Huyett (1957).

\examples{
power_best_binomial(p1 = 0.8, dif = 0.2, ngroups = 4, npergroup = 50)
