}
\arguments{
\item{noutcomes}{Integer. Number of outcomes to evaluate.}

\item{dif}{Numeric. Difference between the best group and the rest (scalar or vector of length \code{noutcomes}).}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector. Weights for each outcome. If scalar, applied equally.}

\item{ngroups}{Integer. Number of groups.}

\item{npergroup}{Integer or vector. Sample size per group.}

\item{nsimul}{Integer. Number of simulations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with estimated empirical power and 95\% confidence interval.
}
\description{
Estimates the empirical power to rank the most promising group as the best,
based on binomial outcomes, via simulation.
}
\details{
Each outcome is assumed to follow an independent binomial distribution. The
best group is defined as having a probability at least \code{dif} higher than the
other groups. The function sums weighted ranks across multiple outcomes to
determine the top group.

If multiple outcomes are defined, weights can be applied to prioritize some
outcomes over others. Weights are automatically scaled to sum to the number
of outcomes. The group with the lowest total rank is considered the best.
