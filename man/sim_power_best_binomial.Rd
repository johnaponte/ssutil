\arguments{
\item{noutcomes}{Integer. Number of outcomes to evaluate.}

\item{p1}{Numeric. Probability in the most promising group (scalar or vector).}

\item{dif}{Numeric. Difference between the best group and the rest.}

\item{ngroups}{Integer. Number of groups.}

\item{npergroup}{Integer or vector. Number of subjects per group.}

\item{nsim}{Integer. Number of simulations.}

\item{conf.level}{Numeric. Confidence level for the empirical power estimate}

\value{
an S3 object of class \link{empirical_power_result}
}
\description{
Estimates the empirical power to correctly identify the best group as having
the highest outcome, under a binomial distribution. Assumes that the most
promising group has a higher success probability than the others by at least
\code{dif}, and that outcomes are independent.
}
\details{
Multiple outcomes can be evaluated simultaneously. The power is estimated as
the proportion of simulations where the most promising group is selected best
in all outcomes.
