\title{Sample Size for Selecting the Best Treatment in a Normal Response (Indifference-Zone)}
\usage{
ss_best_normal(groups, delta, sd, power, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{groups}{Integer. Number of groups (treatments) being compared.}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Minimum difference in means between the best group and the second-best that is considered meaningful.}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Common standard deviation of the response variable.}

\item{power}{Numeric. Desired probability of correctly selecting the best group (must be between 0 and 1).}

\item{seed}{Optional. Integer seed to use in the internal call to \code{multz()}.}
}
\value{
Integer. Sample size required per group to achieve the specified power.
}
\description{
Calculates the minimum common sample size per group needed to achieve a specified
probability (power) of correctly selecting the best group using the
indifference-zone approach. This method assumes normally distributed responses with
a known and common standard deviation.
}
\details{
The indifference-zone approach guarantees that the probability of correct selection
is at least \code{power}, assuming the best group's mean exceeds the others by at
least \code{delta}. The calculation is based on Bechhofer's Procedure Nb.
}
\note{
The function uses the quantile function \code{multz()}, which computes critical values
for the selection procedure. This implementation assumes equal variances and independent samples.
